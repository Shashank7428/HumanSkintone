# HumanSkintone
Created A model to classify the Skintone of Human Face
Human skin tone ranges from the darkest brown to the brightest hues. We can see a variation of skin tones across different geographical regions which are a reason of regions climatic condition, pigmentation or the result of genetics that is inherited from one's biological parents.
We have targetted to create a model which detects the human skin tone by extracting the facial features and giving an output which is in the range of ['mild','fair','dark']
